# Our Data

- American Kennel Club dataset from data.world 
- Gives lowest and highest heights and weights for each of 150 dog breeds 

# Unicode Error Importing Our Data
- Used Pandas (pd.read_csv())
- But our csv file was a "Latin1" file or a "ISO-8859-1" file
- Added an argument to our read_csv() function that included the encoding information and eliminated the error
