# We Like Dogs
So we analyzed data about dogs 

# Our Data

- American Kennel Club dataset from data.world 
- Gives lowest and highest heights and weights for each of 150 dog breeds 

# Unicode Error Importing Our Data
- Used Pandas (pd.read_csv())
- But our csv file was a "Latin1" file or a "ISO-8859-1" file
- Added an argument to our read_csv() function that included the encoding information and eliminated the error

# Our Data

# Added New Columns for Average Height and Weight

#Found Average Height
- Using np.mean(average_height), we found the average height to be 19.5 inches
- Which is equivalent to the average heights of these good bois:
