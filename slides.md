# We Like Dogs
So we analyzed data about dogs 

#Our Data

- American Kennel Club dataset from data.world 
- Gives lowest and highest heights and weights for each of 150 dog breeds 

#Unicode Error Importing Our Data
- Used Pandas (pd.read_csv())
- But our csv file was a "Latin1" file or a "ISO-8859-1" file
- Added an argument to our read_csv() function that included the encoding information and eliminated the error

#Our Data

#Added New Columns for Average Height and Weight

#Generated an Exploratory Pear Plot
- Wanted to take a closer look at the scatter plot and histograms

#Scatter Plot of Average Height & Weight

#Histogram of Average Height
